FAB (Unreal Marketplace) Listing: https://www.fab.com/listings/2485519f-b6d7-494a-9f48-5bc92a575129


The Targeting System is a complete solution for customized, directional targeting in UE4, and is completely networked and multiplayer ready.ï»¿  Designed from the ground up for ease of use, all of its functionality is detailed in a single, plug and play component.

It uses the AI Perception System to perceive targets, and sorts the targets onto 3 categories:
- the most ideal actor to target immediately;
- actors to the left of the targeted actor;
- and actors to the right of the targeted actor;
thus enabling you to switch targets clockwise and anti-clockwise: to the left and right.

There are several options for customization available to the user and exposed on the instance of the component for easy, quick prototyping.
